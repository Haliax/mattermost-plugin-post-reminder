# Mattermost Post Reminder Plugin

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/haliax/mattermost-plugin-post-reminder)](https://github.com/haliax/mattermost-plugin-post/reminder/releases/latest)

**Maintainer:** [@Haliax](https://github.com/Haliax)

### Archived
From Mattermost v7.10, using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, you can set a timed reminder on posts made in channels, direct messages, and group messages.

Therefore, this plugin is not needed anymore.

### Acknowledgment

This plugin is strongly based on the [Mattermost Todo Plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-todo) and reuses a lot of code from there.
